### 3. Notes

🧠 Approach

The site was built using modern React, typescript and Tailwind CSS practices. Key features include:
• Component-based layout for maintainability
• Responsive design for all major breakpoints
• Tailwind utility classes for styling
• Mock data arrays used for FAQs and pharmacies
• Conditional rendering for elements like the review banner and navigation

🔧 What I’d Improve With More Time

If given more time, I would:
• Refine layout and match spacing & styles more precisely to the design
• Improve component organization and reuse by abstracting utility class patterns
• Add basic animations or packages such as MUI for interactions (FAQ toggles, mobile menu, etc.)
• Expand mobile nav behavior with a sliding drawer and overlay
• Ensure accessibility best practices across all components
• Remove unused assets etc.
